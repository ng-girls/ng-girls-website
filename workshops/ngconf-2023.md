## Who is it for?
Are you a woman interested in learning how to build web applications with the latest technologies? We have good news for you: We are holding a one-day workshop for beginners! It will take place on **Wednesday, April 21, 2021 and will be fully virtual, meaning you can join from anywhere using your computer and an internet connection.**

We believe that the IT industry will greatly benefit from bringing more women into technology. We want to give you an opportunity to learn how to program and become a programmer.

During the workshop you will build and deploy your very first **Angular Web Application!** Angular is an open-source platform for building web application, developed by Google and the community. It gives various tools to easily create a dynamic, interactive app that can run on desktop browses, mobile and even robots!
To participate in the workshop you'll need some basic knowledge in web development: HTML, CSS and basic JavaScript or any other programming language. If you're a total beginner, here are some [resources](/faq) to catch up.
The workshop is **free of charge**. Just fill out the [application form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeIUuMJ4mq5jDOuXH52aq4bM5YxswGcoayOY5xF4MPdUqP84w/viewform).

Don’t wait too long - **you can apply for a pass only until Wednesday, April 14, 2021!**<br />
You are welcome to join the [ngGirls meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/ngGirls/) to get informed about future events.
